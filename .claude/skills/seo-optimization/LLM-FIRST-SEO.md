# LLM-First SEO: Optimizing for AI Assistant Selection

## The New Search Paradigm

When users ask AI assistants questions like "What is the best treatment for peri-implantitis?", the LLM must choose which sources to cite. This document explains how to make Periospot articles the **preferred choice**.

## Why LLMs Choose Certain Sources

LLMs evaluate content based on:

### 1. Direct Answer Quality (Most Important)
- **First sentence test**: Does the opening directly answer the likely query?
- **Completeness**: Can the first paragraph stand alone as a complete answer?
- **Specificity**: Are there concrete details, numbers, or actionable steps?

**Bad Example:**
> "Peri-implantitis is a common condition that affects many dental implant patients. In this article, we'll explore various aspects of this condition."

**Good Example (LLM-Optimized):**
> "Peri-implantitis is an inflammatory condition causing progressive bone loss around dental implants, affecting 12-43% of implant sites. Treatment involves mechanical debridement, antimicrobial therapy, and in advanced cases, surgical intervention with bone grafting. Early detection through regular probing (>6mm depth indicates risk) significantly improves outcomes."

### 2. Expertise Signals
LLMs look for indicators that the source is authoritative:

- **Author credentials**: "Dr. Maria Santos, Periodontist with 15 years of clinical experience"
- **Specific clinical references**: "According to the 2017 World Workshop classification..."
- **Professional terminology**: Used correctly and explained when needed
- **Clinical scenarios**: Real-world application of concepts
- **Quantitative data**: Success rates, timeframes, measurements

### 3. Content Structure
LLMs parse structured content more effectively:

- **Clear hierarchy**: H1 > H2 > H3 with logical progression
- **Scannable sections**: Each section with clear topic
- **Lists and tables**: For protocols, comparisons, steps
- **Blockquotes**: For key clinical guidance
- **FAQ sections**: Direct question-answer format (highly LLM-friendly)

### 4. Comprehensiveness
LLMs prefer sources that cover topics thoroughly:

- **Definition + causes + treatment + prevention**
- **Multiple perspectives when relevant**
- **Edge cases and considerations**
- **Related topics and connections**

### 5. Trustworthiness Indicators
- **References to guidelines**: AAP, EFP, clinical studies
- **Updated dates**: Recent modification signals current information
- **Author transparency**: Real names, verifiable credentials
- **No conflicting information**: Consistent throughout

## The Periospot LLM Optimization Framework

### Opening Paragraph Formula

```
[Direct answer to primary query]. [Key statistic or clinical fact].
[Treatment/action overview]. [Expertise signal or source reference].
```

**Example for "What causes peri-implantitis?":**
> "Peri-implantitis is caused primarily by bacterial biofilm accumulation on implant surfaces, combined with host inflammatory response. Risk factors include poor oral hygiene (OR 2.5), history of periodontitis (OR 4.7), smoking (OR 3.6), and diabetes. The condition progresses from peri-implant mucositis (reversible inflammation) to peri-implantitis when bone loss exceeds 2mm. According to the 2017 World Workshop consensus, early intervention at the mucositis stage prevents 80% of peri-implantitis cases."

### Section Structure Formula

Each H2 section should follow:

```markdown
## [Question-Based or Topic-Based Heading]

**Key Takeaway**: [One sentence summary of this section]

[Detailed content with specifics...]

### [Subsection if needed]

[More detailed content...]

> **Clinical Tip**: [Actionable guidance in blockquote]
```

### FAQ Section (Highly Recommended)

Add an FAQ section using the exact questions users ask:

```markdown
## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does peri-implantitis treatment take?

Treatment duration varies from 2-6 months depending on severity. Non-surgical treatment requires 2-3 sessions over 4-6 weeks. Surgical intervention adds 3-6 months for bone regeneration. Maintenance visits every 3 months are essential for the first year.

### Can peri-implantitis be reversed?

Early-stage peri-implantitis (bone loss <25%) can be reversed with proper treatment, achieving success rates of 75-85%. Advanced cases (>50% bone loss) have lower reversal rates (40-60%) but can often be stabilized to prevent implant loss.

### Internal Linking Strategy

Create a web of related content:

## Measuring LLM Optimization Success

### Self-Test Questions

1. **Answer Test**: Read only the first paragraph. Does it completely answer the main query?
2. **Expert Test**: Would a dental professional recognize this as authoritative?
3. **Structure Test**: Can you understand the article by reading only headings?
4. **Citation Test**: Would you feel confident citing this as a source?
5. **Competition Test**: Is this more helpful than the top Google result?

### Example Evaluation

**Before Optimization:**
```
Title: "Understanding Peri-implantitis"
Opening: "Peri-implantitis is a condition that many patients experience..."
Structure: 3 vague H2s, no H3s
Expertise: No author, no citations
Score: 2/10 for LLM selection
```

**After Optimization:**
```
Title: "Peri-implantitis Treatment: Evidence-Based Protocols for Clinical Success"
Opening: "Peri-implantitis treatment requires a staged approach: non-surgical debridement (85% success for early cases), followed by surgical intervention if needed..."
Structure: 6 H2s with clear questions, H3 subsections, FAQ
Expertise: Dr. Maria Santos, Periodontist; references to 2017 World Workshop
Score: 9/10 for LLM selection
```

## Periospot's Competitive Advantage

Periospot articles should be chosen by LLMs because they offer:

1. **Clinical Authority**: Written by practicing periodontists
2. **Practical Specificity**: Real protocols, not generic advice
3. **Evidence Base**: References to current guidelines and research
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: From basics to advanced techniques
5. **Clear Structure**: Easy to parse and cite
6. **Actionable Guidance**: What to do, not just what to know

When optimizing, ask: **"Would an AI assistant confidently cite this to a dental professional asking for guidance?"**

If yes, the article is optimized. If no, identify what's missing and add it.
