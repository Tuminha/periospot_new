    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let me start by saying that the internet never stops changing. Just when I thought I had seen it all, Web 3.0 came along and made me reconsider how it could impact my profession. In this piece, I'll talk about the implications of Web 3.0 for dentists like myself and our patients. We'll dive into the various ways this technology could benefit the dental field.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, what's Web 3.0? It's the next stage in the internet's evolution, marked by increased intelligence, semantics, and a focus on user experience. Contrasting with Web 2.0's emphasis on content creation and sharing, Web 3.0 is also known as the \"Semantic Web\" or the \"Intelligent Web.\" To grasp this evolution, think of the internet as a giant library, evolving through stages of user interaction:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Web 1.0 (reading): We could only read static web pages with zero interaction. This version was all about providing information without any means to engage with the content or other people.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Web 2.0 (reading and writing): We could create and share content like on social media and blogs, and engage with others. This version allowed users to take an active part in creating and distributing content, resulting in a more social and dynamic web.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Web 3.0 (reading, writing, and understanding): The internet becomes more intelligent, semantic, and user-centric. By leveraging AI, machine learning, and blockchain, the web delivers personalized experiences and enables automation and service integration. This version aims to create a more interconnected and intuitive experience for users, allowing computers to understand and process information more effectively.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, let's talk about the \"Semantic Web.\" Its goal is to present information in a way that computers can easily understand, as opposed to the current, unstructured data on the internet. Technologies like RDF (Resource Description Framework) and OWL (Web Ontology Language) will structure information more meaningfully for computers, enabling them to understand relationships between various data pieces.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the Semantic Web, web pages and data sources will use these technologies so that machines can understand what the information on the page is about, who created it, and how it relates to other information. This will enable computers to automatically link and combine information from different sources, making it easier for people to find and use the information they need.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Alright, now let's get to the exciting part: how Web 3.0 could impact dentistry in areas like patient care, research, and education.

Patients often seek the advice of friends, family, and colleagues when searching for a dental professional, making word-of-mouth marketing a crucial aspect of attracting new patients and retaining existing ones. In fact, a study published in the Journal of Dental Education found that 71% of dental patients rely on word-of-mouth referrals from friends and family when choosing a dentist.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Tokenized dentistry and blockchain technology can create an innovative and effective combined marketing approach that incorporates both word-of-mouth and affiliate marketing. By leveraging blockchain, dental practices can offer a reward system for patients who refer new patients, effectively creating a referral program on the blockchain.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here's an example of how a blockchain-based referral program could work:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>A dental practice creates its own dental-specific tokens on a blockchain network, such as Ethereum. Let's call this token \"DentalReferralCoin.\"</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Existing patients receive DentalReferralCoins as a reward for referring new patients to the dental practice. The dental practice can set the reward amount and create a smart contract on the blockchain to automatically distribute the tokens when specific conditions are met (e.g., when the referred patient completes their first appointment).</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Referred patients could also receive DentalReferralCoins as an incentive for trying the dental practice, encouraging them to choose the practice over competitors.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>DentalReferralCoins can be redeemed for dental services within the practice or exchanged for other services within the tokenized dental ecosystem. Patients could also trade DentalReferralCoins on crypto exchanges for other cryptocurrencies or fiat money, depending on the token's design and market demand.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>The blockchain-based referral program would ensure transparency and security, as all transactions would be recorded on the blockchain and visible to all parties involved. This would help build trust among patients and dental professionals and encourage more referrals.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>As more patients participate in the referral program, the dental practice's word-of-mouth marketing would expand, potentially attracting more new patients and creating a larger network of satisfied clients.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By combining tokenized dentistry with word-of-mouth and affiliate marketing, dental practices can create a secure, transparent, and incentivized referral program that encourages patients to share their positive experiences with others. This approach can not only help increase the effectiveness of word-of-mouth marketing but also foster patient loyalty and trust in the dental practice, ultimately leading to business growth and improved patient care.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In conclusion, Web 3.0 is undeniably a game-changer for the dental profession. It opens up countless possibilities in patient care, research, and education, helping dentists like me understand our patients better and make more informed decisions. As the internet continues to evolve, I'm eager to see how Web 3.0 will revolutionize the way I practice dentistry and enhance my patients' experiences.

I remember that day I chose \"The80's playlist” from my iPod. \"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">It was what I used to listen to bring some action during my not-so-large days of work . Yes, it's fantastic to hear from some of my pals how proud they are when they perform a full-arch immediate loading or a bilateral sinus lift surgery at 9 pm. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">I congratulate them on that, but it doesn't suit my lifestyle anymore, although I might be poorer for refusing to perform block grafts after midnight).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">While\" Right Between the Eyes\" was playing in the background (I know, sometimes I feel a little bit nostalgic about the eighties), something not so usual happened: I was finishing harvesting a massive slice of connective tissue, and the palatal artery just decided to be where it shouldn't be (or maybe that was my first complaint –\"anatomical aberration,” I said).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">That was what I consider a shot \"Right between the eyes.\" First, I solved that bloody mess constraining the palatal artery with a ligature suture and then pressuring with gauze for 15 minutes. Fortunately, it stopped bleeding, and my patient didn't even realize something wrong had happened. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">I finished the surgery without any other inconvenience (almost any inconvenience: my patient couldn't pay the bill.

Hence, a graft from tuberosity and posterior-lateral palate is unlikely to undergo postoperative shrinkage. Still, on the other hand, they are more prone to undergo necrosis than the anterior palate. Therefore, I strongly advise you to cover these grafts completely.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">An excellent option for deciding the donor site is using an endodontic needle with a silicon disc.

Therefore we can reference a No. 15 scalpel blade with a cutting portion of approximately 8 mm(Zuhr et al. 2014).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">After we decided on the graft size, two vertical and horizontal incisions should be created inside the envelope.

Let´s go through it right now:</p>\n</div>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer -->\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<div id=\"u33077-4\" class=\"clearfix colelem\" data-muse-uid=\"U33077\">\n<h2>#1 The Site Classification</h2>\n</div>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer -->\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<div id=\"u33076-24\" class=\"clearfix colelem\" data-muse-uid=\"U33076\">\n<p>There are three type of sites that will help us to make decision about which approach should we consider to place (or not to place) the implant (Smith &amp; Tarnow 2013).</p>\n<p><span id=\"u33076-5\">Type A socket:</span> This kind of socket has enough septal bone to surround the entire implant and the primary stability is entirely supplied by the septum.</p>\n<p><span id=\"u33076-9\">Type B socket</span>: The septal bone will partially surround the implant, enough to achieve a minimal torque value, although sometimes the implant has to be placed slightly apically (3-5 mm) in order to achieve primary stability (Schwartz-Arad &amp; Chaushu 1997a).</p>\n<p><span id=\"u33076-13\">Type C Socket</span>: In this type of sockets the shape of the site is similar to an hourglass where the thickened area corresponds to the furcation. The problem of placing immediate implants in this type of site is that you have to engage your implant (really wide implant. 7-9 mm wide) to the buccal and lingual walls which if not performed properly is very likely to undergo into a bone resorption. This kind of sockets in my experience are a “no-bet” for me, and I only play the odds here if I can get primary stability apically to the socket.</p>\n<p>I also loved the way José Navarro <a class=\"nonblock\" href=\"https://www.for.org/en/video-insights/jos%C3%A9-navarro-art-immediate-molar-implant-placement\">presented here</a> this topic at FOR page.</p>\n</div>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer -->\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":138,\"align\":\"center\",\"className\":\"wp-image-138\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter wp-image-138\"><img src=\"https://periospot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/type-11-01-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"type 11 -01\" class=\"wp-image-138\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Type A socket.

Some authors described that the minimal implant torque value (ITV) should be 15 N·cm and with this torque the expected survival rate will be around 86%, although when that implant minimal torque value is greater than 30 N·cm the survival rate will increase to 90% (Walker et al. 2011). But let’s get serious with this. Torque does not always tell us the truth and that’s why we have other ways to get more information on what is really happening down there when an implant is placed. I´m really an Osstell advocate.\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Whenever I doubt the survival probability of an implant that I just placed, I pick up my Osstell and I control the ISQ evolution of that implant by measuring the ISQ values during the healing time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If we combine a good implant torque with an acceptable ISQ value, where you’d want to have a torque value over 30 N·cm and an ISQ value above 60, our implant is very likely to be successful (Block 2011). (in another article I’ll give you the rational on this topic - Osstell and Torque values) #3 Anatomical Limitations As you know, in the upper jaw the major limitation is the sinus, and in the lower jaw the dental nerve is more than a limitation, is an untouchable structure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Does this mean that if the sinus is close to the remaining site after the molar extraction, I will not be able to perform an immediate implant in the upper jaw? The answer is NO! It is described in the literature how an immediate implant in a molar site can be performed simultaneously to a sinus floor augmentation via osteotomes (Artzi et al. 2003).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can see a full case here performed by Daniel Rodrigo. This guy is just amazing. Unfortunately that option cannot be performed in the lower jaw, because inferior alveolar nerve lateralization cannot be justified to allow an immediate implant.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer -->\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:html /-->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-the-remaining-gap-what-should-i-do-with-it\">#4 The remaining gap. What should I do with it?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This topic could be the responsible for the next World War III. Some authors are advocates of not filling the gap with nothing more than the blood clot (Schwartz-Arad &amp; Chaushu 1997b; Wöhrle 1998; Tarnow &amp; Chu 2011), and others state that in some conditions gaps should be filled with some bone substitute if the gap is superior to 2 mm (Akimoto et al. 1999; Wilson et al. 1998). Since we are going to perform a flapless approach, we should consider always filling the buccal gap, as it could help to preserve the dimensions of the ridge (Araújo et al. 2011).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer -->\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-5-finally-when-not-to-perform-an-immediate-implant\">#5 Finally: When not to perform an immediate implant</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We all use “To-Do” lists, and we love them. I my self I´m an Evernote and Wunderlist advocate. It helps to keep me organized and disciplined. But sometimes I think that even more important than having a “To-Do” list, is having a “Not-To-Do” list. Why? It can save us a lot of problems. Let´s be clear here: if some or all the buccal wall is missing, don´t try to be a hero (your patients don´t need a hero, they just need a dentist) and just do a staged approach- Regenerate and then do a delayed implant placement, like my pal said on my post on Facebook. Add this to your \"Not-To-Do\" list.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There’s a catch: It is possible that you may have to perform a guided bone regeneration after the healing time, if a severe bone remodeling occurs during the healing period.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer -->\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":3780,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://periospot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/batman-definitivo-01-crop-u33152-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3780\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Patients dont need a hero, they need a Dentist.</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:group -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:group -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer -->\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-6-extra-bonus-an-animation-to-show-you-the-correct-implant-placement\">#6 Extra Bonus: An animation to show you the correct implant placement</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Creating illustrations and animations really gives me a lot of work, but I feel happy when readers give me their positive feedback. This feedback is even more important when it is about improving or refining, in a small part or a whole, allowing me to provide a proper understanding of what that animation is trying to explain. That´s why this Saturday morning I decided to create this extra content where it is explain how deep your implant should be placed and why is so important to have a correct emergence profile.

It has a great follow up and the number of subjects that were included in the trial is quite considerable (386 patients).</p>\n<p>Following the conclusions that can be found in the literature about this topic, we can state that immediate implants at fresh molar sites is a reliable and predictable treatment if it is performed following some of the simple rules explained above.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoyed this article as much as we enjoyed writing it so&nbsp; subscribe to our newsletter to stay tuned and write us if you would like to collaborate with our program.</p>\n</div>\n<!-- /wp:html -->",

    "content": "<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Nowadays, implantology is a predictable area and well-accepted by the scientific community for missing or doubtful prognosis tooth repositioning. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">More than 30 years ago, Brånemark published the first articles presenting implantology as a safe and predictable method to rehabilitate edentulous patients.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">One of the key factors was the time the implant was submerged until loadin- 3 months for the jaw and 6 months to the maxilla (Bränemark 1977).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Years later, Albrektsson establishes success criteria for every treatment involving implants, where implants should be absent of mobility, pain, radiolucency around the implant, and the bone loss should never bee than 1,5 mm and 0,2 mm per year (Albrektsson 1986).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Although, this is a prevailing criteria, at that time treatments involving implants was mainly functional.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Nowadays we know that our patients are quite demanding regarding aesthetic results.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Three years later, Smith published that aesthtics have also an important role in successful implant treatment (Smith 1989).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">For that there are some golden rules that every implantologist should manage to achieve predictable <a href=\"https://periospot.com/the-ideal-implant-position-in-the-aesthetic-zone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">results in the aesthetic zone</a>, and this article there will be described ten rules that everyone should consider:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"u32333-20\"><strong>1) The edentulous gap in the aesthetic zone: When will there be papilla?</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">The presence of papilla between an implant and teeth depends mainly on the presence of interproximal bone peaks in the adjancent tooths.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">If there is not bone peaks, there will not be papilla (Kan 2003). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">There is also a relation between the presence of the papilla and the distance between the contact point and the bone crest (Tarnow 1992).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">There will be a high likelihood of complete presence of papilla if this distance is 5mm or less. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">This probability goes down for  6 mm (56%) and 7 mm (27%) of distance.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Although the trial was performed in natural tooth, Salama (Salama 1998) and co-workers found that 4,5 mm of papilla was the average amount of papilla that we should expect to have between an implant and tooth if a distance of at least 1,5 mm was maintained between an implant and tooth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also read more about Tarnow's article in <a href=\"https://periospot.com/5-scientific-publications-implant-dentistry-read-caution/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer

wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">This technique is the most straightforward option to start with.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">It is almost mandatory to know this option if you are going to perform guided bone regeneration where bone blocks or PTFE membranes are going to be used.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">The idea behind this

{\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">This approach was published by De&nbsp;Stavola (De&nbsp;Stavola&nbsp;2014).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">The idea is to reduce the tension before&nbsp;the final horizontal mattress and interrupted sutures are

wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Very simply:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph

wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">2) The internal suture involves only the inner part of the vestibular flap, which avoids any “killer loop effect” on the marginal vascularity of the flap.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\"><em>3) A</em>fter the knots are tightened, the vestibular flap slips coronally.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p

style=\"font-size:22px\">The use of&nbsp;pins increases the&nbsp;risk of perforating important anatomical structures, such as the inferior alveolar nerve, the maxillary sinus, or the roots of teeth adjacent to the surgical site.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">So you have a few&nbsp;good reasons to

{\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">One of the most challenging moments during a guided bone regeneration procedure is the membrane positioning and

This insight fundamentally changes how we should think about implant positioning.\n\nWhen we talk about implant depth, we're really discussing three distinct approaches: Supracrestal, Equicrestal, and Subcrestal positioning. Each has its place, but not all implant systems are designed for all positions.\n\nThe key insight? Implants entirely embedded in trabecular bone produce the lowest stress and strain compared to epicrestal placement. But the type of connection matters enormously - Morse cone connections with platform switching remain the most favorable design for subcrestal placement.\n\nAs I like to say: An implant system is like a boyfriend - if you don't know him very well, he may cause you lots of problems. Know your implant system, understand the biological principles, and let the evidence guide your clinical decisions.",

We often see this kind of case where the implant is aspirated into the sinus. This complication is mainly due to the lack of implant primary stability when it is placed in the posterior maxilla where the bone quality is low (Norton 2001, Damlar 2015).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It can happen to everyone. It didn´t happen to me yet, mainly because when I´m not sure about the implant primary stability during a sinus floor augmentation (low torque and ISQ below 60), I prefer to perform the two stages approach. First I regenerate and then I place the implants.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, I use wide neck implants or conical implants, although there is no literature that supports this statement, it makes sense that a conical implant or a wide neck implant are less likely to disappear into the sinus than a straight implant.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In this case, I think two mistakes were committed:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>The implant was placed with no primary stability</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>It was used a healing abutment, which may cause a pseudo-loading that lead to the loss of implant stability.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thanks <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/matteo__negri/?hl=es\">Matteo_negri</a> for sharing this case.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://www.instagram.com/p/3j8bMqH2Ew/?taken-by=matteo__negri\",\"type\":\"rich\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"instagram\",\"responsive\":true,\"className\":\"\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/3j8bMqH2Ew/?taken-by=matteo__negri\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Shit can happen to those who perform implant dentistry.

Anatomically, sockets type A or B are the most favorable to immediate implants in order to achieve primary stability (Schwartz-Arad 1997).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In our study, we did not find sockets type C, but according to the references consulted, we will have to select wide diameter implants to engage the buccal and lingual walls which if it is not performed correctly, the risk of bone resorption will increase significantly. This was also suggested in <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://periospot.com/5-concepts-to-achieve-a-successful-immediate-implant-placement-into-a-fresh-molar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this article</a>.</span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From a biological perspective, it was thought that the immediate implant was able to stop the bone remodeling and maintain the volume and shape of the surrounding tissues. However, this technique is not able to preserve the coronal portion of the buccal plate. Araujo et al. in 2005, showed in their experimental study in animals, that after dental extraction, the periodontal blood vessels in thin bone tables are damaged, this being the probable cause of the consequent bone resorption (Araujo 2005).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 2010, Hürzeler et al. proposed an alternative to the immediate implants in the anterior maxilla, the<span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"> <a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/oral-implantology/id522445418?mt=11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\"socket shield\"</a></span>. This technique involves the maintenance or partial preservation of the vestibular dental root with the purpose of avoiding subsequent tissue alterations (Hürzeler 2010). This technique is just recommended to the aesthetic area and authors as Langer et al. suggests caution, since the intentional or involuntary presence of a dental tooth is a potential niche for pathogens and therefore, can produce osteolysis of the bone surrounding the implant and compromise the osseointegration (Langer 2015).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fugazzotto is maybe one of the most worlds experimented professionals about immediate implants in molar extractions. He recommended that implants may be placed in ideal restorative positions at the time of molar extraction with or without concomitant regenerative therapy (Fugazzotto 2008). In our case, the four implants were fixed into the septum, which is the ideal position for a transmission of the occlusal forces on the axial axis of the implant.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Two socket gaps were filled with bone grafting material to maintain the hard tissue contour. Some authors as Degidi et all used (Bio-oss®, Geistlich Pharma) to fill the gap with excellent results (Degidi 2015). Nowadays, there is no evidence in the literature consulted about which is the best grafting material (Schwartz-Arad 1007, Clementini 2015, Araujo 2005, Fugazzotto 2008, Degidi 2013). Furthermore, the currently available evidence does not allow for any conclusive statements regarding the efficacy of a concomitant regenerative technique in preventing the amount of alveolar reduction /Clementini 2015, Araujo 2005).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The tapered implant design, with switching platform, had less bone resorption compared with traditional matching implants.16 We used four dental implants (Alvim CM, Neodent) with a tapered design, switching platform, cone morse connection and unpolished surface to get bone over the implant platform leaving the implant placement 2 mm subcrestal. Chu et al. reported that subcrestal placement decreased the peak of compressive stress at the crestal cortical bone and transferred it toward the trabecular bone (Chu 2011).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":1208,\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://periospot.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screenshot-2018-04-29-12.59.27-1024x218.png\" alt=\"Immediate implant (Alvim, Neodent®) with the definitive Micro-abutment placed the same day of the surgery.\" class=\"wp-image-1208\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fig.3-&nbsp;Immediate implant (Alvim, Neodent®) with the definitive Micro-abutment placed the same day of the surgery.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The CM connection has a virtual absence of microgap and, therefore, of micro-movements (Weng 2011).

Por ejemplo, si vamos a hablar de fonética y apiñamiento una buena historia sería contar la historia de Freddie Mercury que tenia los incisivos muy vestibularizados pero se negaba a ser tratado con miedo a que afectara sus habilidades vocales.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer -->\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">2.  <strong>Cambio de dinámica:</strong> Una historia necesita un cambio de guión para hacerla más atractiva. ¿Qué ha pasado para que la historia no terminará como se preveía? Por ejemplo, cuando explico el Platform Switching (concepto en implantología), me gusta contar la historia detrás de este accidental descubrimiento y hacer una analogía con la Viagra. Asi me lo han explicado y lo recordaré siempre.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Hacer uso de una buena historia ligada a nuestra presentación hará que el mensaje tenga más fuerza y sea más memorable.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-7-la-regla-del-10-20-30\"><strong>#7 La regla del 10/20/30</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Guy Kawasaki, un guru de la comunicación y brand evangelist de Apple entre otras marcas, aconseja aplicar la regla del 10/20/30 en las presentaciones: Máximo 10 diapositivas, duración de 20 minutos y el tamaño de la letra no inferior a 30.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Si bien es cierto que en muchas presentaciones en algún symposium o congreso tienen la duración de más de veinte minutos, debemos ajustar al máximo el número de diapositivas, y que cada una tenga un mensaje detrás.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Todos hemos asistido a presentaciones armadas de un carrusel de diapositivas, efectos y animaciones que únicamente consiguen distraer a la audiencia. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Animaciones y efectos sí, pero con mesura.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Por otro lado la regla del tamaño de la tipografía a mínimo 30 es una regla basada en la edad de nuestra audiencia. Idealmente nuestra letra no debería ser menor que la mitad de la edad de la persona con más años de la audiencia: si creemos que la persona de mayor de edad en la sala debe de rondar los 70 años, pues no bajemos el tamaño de la letra de 35.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-8-uso-del-humor\"><strong>#8.

Es un gran recurso para mantener la audiencia atenta, pero no se debe abusar: 2-3 salidas de buen humor cada 20 minutos es aceptable.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Por supuesto, evitar chistes sexistas, racistas y sobre religión y últimamente política. Tenemos que también conocer bien la audiencia que tenemos delante si queremos hacer humor, ya que un chiste sobre el abuso del postureo en las redes sociales delante de una audiencia de que tiene de media 60 años, podría tener un impacto casi nulo.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-9-citas-bibliograficas-nbsp\">#9.

it makes sense, as marginal bone loss can be observed when there is an overload of the implant.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">These overloading compressive forces should be below 100-130 Mpa to avoid bone resorption around the neck of the implant (Natali 2003). &nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">But the catch is that if the same compressive force is applied to an implant placed subcrestally and epicrestally, the peak compressive stress will be different for both positions, where the implant placed crestally will have a peak comprehensive stress above the physiological limit for cortical bone tissue (Sotto-Maior 2014).&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">These findings could also be observed in clinical research, where implants placed subcrestally had a much higher survival rate and even a coronal bone ingrowth around the implant-abutment interface (Lee 2010).&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Also, the other force that will be present during occlusal movements will be the tensile forces. These tensile forces may be responsible for the expression of BMP-2 and BMP-4,&nbsp; which stimulate ossification, but these forces should never overload the implant, which would cause the contrary effect (Sato, 1999).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\"><strong>Summarizing the last three paragraphs, we could say that implants that are placed subcrestally and are entirely embedded in trabecular bone produce the lowest stress and strain compared to those places in an epicrestal position (Sotto-Maior, 2014).</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"textAlign\":\"left\"} -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-left\" id=\"h-but-does-this-mean-that-all-of-the-implants-should-be-placed-subcrestally\"><strong>But does this mean that all of the implants should be placed subcrestally?</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Far from that, some implants are prepared to be positioned in a subcrestal position.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">It depends on the type of connection that the implant has.

This given surface with specific characteristics may also be osseointegrated when connected to an implant placed subcrestally (Welander, 2009).&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">From a biological point of view, this can be an asset, as this connection between the abutment and the marginal bone may provide extra protection against attempts from some pathogens to colonize the implant surface that would lead to peri-implantitis.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Imagine placing the implant below in a subcrestal position with all the micromotion that it has between the abutment and the implant.

Placing the transepithelial abutment on the same day of the surgery is essential to avoid a second stage where if a cover screw is placed, further surgical trauma has to be done to uncover the implant.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":1528,\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://periospot.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3-implants-positionated-_Mesa-de-trabajo-1-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1528\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Different implant philosophy: Tissue Level in a supracrestal position, Bone Level Tapered in a crestal position with SRA abutment and Helix Implant in a subcrestal position with a Micro-Abutment. Is important to note that when an implant is placed subcrestally, the second gap of the abutment (between abutment- restoration) should be located at least 1 mm. above the bone crest.</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Furthermore, the disconnection of the healing abutment, provisional abutment, and other abutments directly into the connection may cause an apical migration of the crestal bone and soft tissue recession (Abrahamsson, 1997).&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://youtu.be/ky-fFR5IXbA\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://youtu.be/ky-fFR5IXbA\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">It is important to mention that if the implant did not achieve at least the recommended torque of the definitive abutment—let us say 32 N.Cm, which is the recommended torque for the GM abutment from Neodent—the initial torque should be less than the insertion torque of the implant. Moreover, after the healing phase, the definitive torque is applied to the abutment.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Also, implants with a low ISQ (&lt;60) should be approached with a two-stage philosophy to avoid any micro-motions in the implant during the healing period (Szmukler-Moncler, 1998). This pseudo-loading could jeopardize the osseointegration process of the implant (Touati, 2001).&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">In the video below you can check the protocol for a subcrestal implant placement (Neodent GM Implant, Straumann Group).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-DiFyVDylw\\u0026t=147s\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"responsive\":true,\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-DiFyVDylw&amp;t=147s\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">To finish this article, let us quickly mention the Bee-Gees song, “How Deep Is Your Love,” where it seems like the deeper the love, the better.

En esa época los fotógrafos no tenían ni idea de computadores, de software o de histogramas, sólo sabían de una cosa: FOTOGRAFÍA. Había quien sabía incluso de los procesos químicos para poder revelar sus fotografías (blanco y negro, sobre todo) en un cuarto oscuro y cuando el proceso era en color o más laborioso se llevaban a un laboratorio, donde había una persona encargada del tema.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Luego llegó la era digital, aunque ha tardado mucho tiempo en llegar a todos, desde 1975 que se inventó la primera cámara digital (Kodak) hasta ahora que todo el mundo tiene una cámara digital, aunque sea de móvil.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Con el auge de las cámaras fotográficas, uno de los primeros softwares que se introdujo en esto fue el <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/es/products/photoshop.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw9JzoBRDjARIsAGcdIDWZuqIA8HmEeclhr0j0zx3dBnVQsAYayMTzdF7N9ZTKCb4d_JDhpN8aAqFQEALw_wcB&amp;sdid=8DN85NTQ&amp;mv=search&amp;ef_id=Cj0KCQjw9JzoBRDjARIsAGcdIDWZuqIA8HmEeclhr0j0zx3dBnVQsAYayMTzdF7N9ZTKCb4d_JDhpN8aAqFQEALw_wcB:G:s&amp;s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!340859178371!e!!g!!adobe%20photoshop&amp;red=a\"><span style=\"color:#0693e3\" class=\"color\">Adobe Photoshop</span>,</a> que acaparó todo el mercado, y lo que hacían es que modifican físicamente el archivo digital, es decir, que de alguna manera u otra, lo están “editando”, por eso cuando usamos Photoshop se dice que “editamos las fotografías”.

Esta estimación no es tan precisa como usando una carta de grises, muy necesaria para la comunicación con el laboratorio en procesos de toma de color como en protocolos tipo ELABORAID.

(Think about those folks who, in 2010, said, \"I’ll never have a Facebook account.\" Two years later, they rushed to create one just so that they wouldn’t be the only ones to miss all those videos of cats and dogs playing pianos on social media.

wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Primero explicamos el porqué existe esta pérdida de hueso marginal alrededor de un implante.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Ericsson describió que la pérdida de hueso marginal está relacionada con un concepto de “Infiltración Inflamatorio Celular”- ICT- en el GAP existente entre el implante y el componente protético (Ericsson 1995).&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer

todos que la distancia mínima que se debe mantener entre dos implantes es de 3 mm (Tarnow 2000) de forma a que esa remodelación ósea que da origen a la perdida ósea marginal en 180º no haga coincidir en un componente horizontal los procesos de remodelación de los dos implantes colocados contiguamente.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer {\"height\":\"24px\"} -->\n<div

-->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Podríamos decir que el Platform-Switching es la Viagra de la implantología.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Descubierta por accidente cuando se popularizó el uso de implantes anchos pero por alguna razón las casa comercial que comercializaba estos implantes más anchos enviaba a sus clientes los componentes protéticos de los implantes de plataforma regular (RP).&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Esto resultaba en la existencia en una discrepancia entre la anchura del implante y el elemento protético o el tapón de cicatrización- llamado mismatch- que resultó tener un impacto en la pérdida de hueso marginal.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Y de ahí sale esta radiografía que es sin duda la la radiografía más relevante en la implantología contemporánea.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":1964,\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://periospot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Captura-de-pantalla-2019-03-17-06.06.47.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1964\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Al alejar el gap, las bacterias y todo el contenido inflamatorio del gap en un sentido horizontal, se observó que había una casi inexistente pérdida de hueso marginal.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Desde un punto de vista clínico esto tiene muchas ventajas y la primera es la estabilidad del tejido periimplantario que a su vez se puede traducir en un mejor mantenimiento de los tejidos blandos alrededor de los implantes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">También parece afectar la prevalencia de enfermedades periimplantarias cuando son comparados con los implantes convencionales, aunque esto se tiene que demostrar a largo plazo y con estudios diseñados para este propósito (Duque 2016).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Otro punto importante es en el uso de implantes cortos. Si en un implante de 6 mm obtenemos una pérdida de hueso marginal de 2 mm, tendríamos el implante únicamente sumergido en 4 mm de hueso. Un drama.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">De ahí, que los implantes cortos o bien incorporan Platform-Switching o bien la filosofía no sumergida Tissue Level que han demostrado ser una excelente opción en casos de pacientes con poca altura ósea (Srinivasan 2013).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Acera de RCT (estudios aleatorizados randomizados) sobre el Platform-Switching, existen unos cuantos (cerca de 23) pero de dudosa relevancia en algunos casos (Santiago 2016).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Por destacar uno, el de Canullo 2010, donde estudia el impacto del tamaño del Mismatch con la pérdida de hueso marginal y concluye que existe una relación directa entre el tamaño del Mismatch y la cantidad de pérdida de hueso marginal.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">En los videos de abajo se explica el porqué, aunque es lógico pensar que al alejar cada vez más en un plano horizontal el contenido infamatorio que se forma en el gap entre el implante y el componente protético, menor impacto en el hueso periimplantario.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer {\"height\":\"22px\"} -->\n<div style=\"height:22px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed

class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Esta diferencia de plataforma es aprovechada de forma acertada por algunos sistemas de implantes como por ejemplo el BLX de Straumann® que incorpora diferentes Mismatch dependiendo del diámetro del implante que puede variar en un Mismatch de 0,45 mm en un implante de ø3,75 mm a un Mismatch de 1 mm de un implante de ø5.5 mm de diámetro.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":1966,\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://periospot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Captura-de-pantalla-2019-03-17-06.57.59.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1966\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Otra de las teorías es la biomecánica que viene diciendo que los implantes que incorporan el concepto de Platform Switching desplazan las zonas de tensión de la zona cervical del implante y del hueso cortical hacia a una zona más interior del implante (Maeda 2007).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Otro impacto relevante a nivel clínico que tiene el Platform-Switching es la dismitificación del mantra que nos persigue desde hace años: Los implantes deben mantener una distancia entre si de mínimo 3 mm.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Un estudio realizado por Ciurana, demuestra que los implantes que incorporan el concepto de Platform-Switching, cuando colocados a menos de 3 mm de distancia -entre 1,5mm a 3 mm- conseguían mantener el pico óseo interproximal y por tanto la altura gingival esperada (Ciurana 2009).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!--

{\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Aunque la aparición del Platform-Switching fue sin duda uno de los grandes avances en la implantología contemporánea, hay que resaltar que no es la panacea.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">De hecho en algunas revisiones sistemáticas no se puede concluir que sea clínicamente beneficioso debido a la gran heterogeneidad de estudios existentes, aunque si es cierto que la pérdida de hueso marginal es menor en casi todos los estudios, en una media de 0,41 mm menos de perdida de hueso marginal frente a por implantes convencionales.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">De hecho, el Platform-Switching por si solo no va a tener un impacto biológico positivo sino viene acompañado de otros factores:&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>La estabilidad de la conexión (Zipprich 2007). </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>El biotipo del paciente (Linkevicius 2014).</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>La desconexión y conexión contínua de elementos protéticos (Abrahamsson 1997).</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Existencia de un Mismatch reducido limita el impacto positivo del Platform Switching (Ekling 2011).</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">A pesar de que el Platform-Switching no resuelve todos los contratiempos biológicos, es sin duda una herramienta que ya pocos clínicos ponen en cuestión y al igual que la ley antitabaco, ha llegado para quedarse.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Ahora ya solo nos queda aprender a pronunciarlo bien.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!--

Últimos retoques.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Parecen muchos pasos, pero una vez llevemos unas cuentas animaciones ya iremos en piloto automático.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Empezamos por la primera.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer -->\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-crear-una-ilustracion-en-adobe-illustrator-nbsp\">Crear una ilustración en Adobe Illustrator&nbsp;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Primero tenemos que decidir qué queremos dibujar. Por ejemplo en este caso ejemplo vamos a dibujar un alveolo con su diente. Para eso os recomiendo que busquéis una fotografía o bien un dibujo de algo similar a lo que queréis diseñar.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"fontSize\":\"medium\"} -->\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">En este video podéis ver cómo se diseña.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer {\"height\":\"40px\"} -->\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://youtu.be/w0QENRMubUs\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"responsive\":true,\"align\":\"wide\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed alignwide is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://youtu.be/w0QENRMubUs\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Por pasos:&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">1. Crear un nuevo documento en illustrator&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">2.  Arrastrar la imagen que queremos replicar.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">3. Empezar a diseñar por encima del dibujo/foto importado con la herramienta de pluma siguiendo la forma del dibujo que tenemos debajo.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">4.

Ajustar las capas al plano requerido. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">6.  Soltar las capas (secuencia). Este paso es muy importante para que después podamos hacer la animación en Adobe After Effects. Ver en el video como se hace. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">7. Guardar la imagen y pasar al siguiente paso: Animar en After Effects. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-animar-la-ilustracion-con-after-effects\">Animar la ilustración con After Effects</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Para animar la ilustración vamos a necesitar la ilustración que hemos realizado en el paso anterior, el <a href=\"https://clk.tradedoubler.com/click?p(264313)a(3102029)g(22913596)url(https://www.adobe.com/es/creativecloud/plans.html?single_app=aftereffects)\"><span style=\"color:#0693e3\" class=\"color\">After Effects</span></a> y algo de paciencia. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Veamos el video tutorial:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer {\"height\":\"34px\"} -->\n<div style=\"height:34px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://youtu.be/Qd5dzoO9_ME\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"responsive\":true,\"align\":\"wide\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed alignwide is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://youtu.be/Qd5dzoO9_ME\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer {\"height\":\"36px\"} -->\n<div style=\"height:36px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Paso a <g class=\"gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"3\" data-gr-id=\"3\">paso</g>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">1.  Importar el archivo Illustrator a nuestro nuevo proyecto en After Effects.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">2.  Al importar en la parte superior izquierda veremos un recuadro con una carpeta donde están las capas de nuestra ilustración. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">3.  Arrastrar las capas a la linea de tiempo.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">4.  Convertir cada capa en una forma editable. Le damos al boton derecho y en crear aparece la opción (Crear&gt;crear formas a partir de la capa vectorial).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">5.  Creamos fotogramas clave iniciales. Este paso es extremadamente importante que lo dominemos ya que marca como queremos la animación al inicio y como se debería de ir moviendo en el tiempo. En el video se ve perfectamente como se marca estos fotogramas clave.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">6.  Arriba elegimos la herramienta de pluma.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">7.  Avanzamos la linea de tiempo, por ejemplo dos segundos, y movemos los puntos hacia donde queramos. En el video podeis ver como muevo la encia para reproducir una recesión. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">8.  Podemos también mover objetos vectoriales enteros, en el video vemos como movemos el diente entero. Una vez mas marcamos el fotograma clave inicial y en el final movemos el objecto hacia donde queremos que se mueva. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">9.  Una vez tenemos nuestra animación lista le damos a Archivo&gt;Añadir a la cola de Adobe Encoder y se abrirá otra apliación de Adobe que si tenéis la Suite completa como mencioné arriba, se os abrira automaticamente.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">10.  En el Encoder elegís el destino del video y le days a play. Empieza la exportación y ya casi estamos listos. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">11.  Una vez tenemos nuestro video-animación, pasamos al último paso: Editar el video para poder personalizarlo en Final Cut o Adobe Premier. Yo utilizo Final Cut, pero si os sucribis al Creative Cloud de Adobe la aplicación de edición de video viene incluida. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ultimo-paso-editar-el-video\">Último paso: Editar el video</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Una vez tenemos nuestra animación en bruto, es hora de darle el toque final. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}}

For example, in this case, we are going to draw an alveolus with the tooth inside. In order to do this,&nbsp;&nbsp;I recommend that you look for a photograph or a drawing of something similar, to what you want to design.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"fontSize\":\"medium\"} -->\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">In this video, you can see how it is designed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer {\"height\":\"40px\"} -->\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://youtu.be/f-n40UMnv0g\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"responsive\":true,\"align\":\"wide\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed alignwide is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://youtu.be/f-n40UMnv0g\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Step by Step:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">1. Create a new document in Illustrator.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">2.  Drag and drop the image we want to replicate.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">3. Start designing over the imported drawing/photo with the pen tool, following the shape of the drawing below.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">4. Once we have finished designing using the pen tool, we can also change the color of the image and the thickness of the line and adjust the drawing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">5.  Adjust the layers. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">6.  Release the layers (in sequence). This step is very important so that later we can make the animation in Adobe After Effects. See in the video how it is done. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">7. Save the image and move on to the next step: Animate in After Effects.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-create-animation-with-adobe-after-effects\">Create animation with Adobe After Effects.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">To animate the illustration, we are going to need the illustration we made in the previous step, the <a href=\"https://clk.tradedoubler.com/click?p(264313)a(3102029)g(22913596)url(https://www.adobe.com/es/creativecloud/plans.html?single_app=aftereffects)\"><span style=\"color:#0693e3\" class=\"color\">After  Effects</span></a> some patience.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Let's watch the video tutorial:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer {\"height\":\"34px\"} -->\n<div style=\"height:34px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://youtu.be/Qd5dzoO9_ME\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"responsive\":true,\"align\":\"wide\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed alignwide is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://youtu.be/Qd5dzoO9_ME\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer {\"height\":\"36px\"} -->\n<div style=\"height:36px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Step by step:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">1.  Import the Illustrator file to our new project in After Effects.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">2.  When importing in the upper left we will see a box with a folder where the layers of our illustration are located. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">3.  Drag the layers to the timeline.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">4.  Convert each layer into an editable format. Select the right button and in the create section, the following option appears, (Create&gt; create forms from the vector layer).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">5.  We then create initial keyframes. This step is extremely important to master as it marks how we want the animation at the beginning, and how it should be moving in time. In the video, you can see perfectly how these keyframes are marked.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">6.  At the top, we select the pen tool.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">7.  We then advance the timeline, for example, two seconds, and move the points where we want them. In the video, you can see how I have moved the gum to reproduce a recession.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">8.  We can also move whole vector objects and in the video, it shows how we move the whole tooth. Once again we mark the initial keyframe and at the end, we move the object to where we want it to move to. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">9.  Once we have our animation list we select&nbsp;&nbsp;File&gt; Add to the Adobe Encoder queue. Another Adobe application will open,&nbsp;&nbsp;if you have the complete Suite as mentioned above, it will be opened automatically.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">10.  In the Encoder, you choose the destination of the video and you can play it from day to day. The export starts and we are almost ready. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">11.  Once we have our video-animation, we go to the last step: Edit the video to be able to customize it in Final Cut or Adobe Premier. I use Final Cut, but if you subscribe to the Adobe Creative Cloud, the video editing application is included. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-last-step-video-edition-with-final-cut-or-adobe-premiere\">Last step: Video edition with Final Cut (or Adobe Premiere).</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Once we have our raw animation, it's time to give it the final touch.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">For this, we can use either&nbsp; <a href=\"https://clk.tradedoubler.com/click?p(264313)a(3102029)g(22913596)url(https://www.adobe.com/es/creativecloud/plans.html?single_app=aftereffects)\"><span style=\"color:#0693e3\" class=\"color\">Adobe Premiere</span></a> (included in the aforementioned <a href=\"https://clk.tradedoubler.com/click?p(264313)a(3102029)g(22913596)url(https://www.adobe.com/es/creativecloud/plans.html?single_app=aftereffects)\"><span style=\"color:#0693e3\" class=\"color\">Creative Cloud</span></a>, <a href=\"https://geni.us/finalcutperiospot\"><span style=\"color:#0693e3\" class=\"color\">Final Cut</span></a> or another video editor that you like.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">This part is simpler, and everyone can customise their video as they wish.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">In my case, I use <a href=\"https://geni.us/finalcutperiospot\"><span style=\"color:#0693e3\" class=\"color\">Final Cut</span></a> because for years it has been&nbsp;my video editor, although&nbsp;<a href=\"https://clk.tradedoubler.com/click?p(264313)a(3102029)g(22913596)url(https://www.adobe.com/es/creativecloud/plans.html?single_app=aftereffects)\"><span style=\"color:#0693e3\" class=\"color\">Adobe Premier</span></a> is also an excellent editor.

wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Un resumen de algunos de los puntos descritos:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\"><strong>Posición mesiodistal:</strong> el implante debe colocarse a 1,5 mm de distancia de los dientes adyacentes. Si es posible, debe colocarse a 2 mm de distancia para evitar que la pérdida ósea marginal afecte el pico óseo interproximal.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">La distancia entre los implantes debe ser de 3 mm, aunque algunos autores declararon que los implantes con Platform Switching podrían colocarse hasta una distancia de 2 mm (Ciurana 2009).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\"><strong>Posición Vestibulopalatina: </strong>la regla general afirma que al menos 2 mm de hueso deben estar presentes alrededor del implante; se debe prestar más atención al lado vestibular donde la reabsorción de la cresta vestibular conducirá a un fracaso estético.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">El hueso alveolar, que no recibe aporte sanguíneo del ligamento periodontal, necesita una anchura ósea de al menos 1,8 mm para no reabsorberse.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\"><strong>Posición apicocoronal: </strong>el implante debe colocarse 3-4 mm por debajo del margen gingival de la futura restauración. Los implantes que se colocan demasiado coronalmente no tendrán suficiente espacio para el perfil de emergencia.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Ahora que tenemos una idea clara de cómo deben colocarse los implantes en la zona estética, podemos elegir los materiales correctos y colocarlos en una posición adecuada.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">El odontólogo es responsable de conducir el autobús con las personas adecuadas (implantes) y sentarlos en la posición correcta (conocimiento biológico).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph

No obstante, para los que este asunto les pudiera generar cuadros de ansiedad post traumática quiero destacar que, las diferencias entre sondar con o sin prótesis, tiene una diferencia de 1mm o menos en el 80% de los casos. (Serino y col 2013), mas que aceptable, ¿no os parece?. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer -->\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":2449,\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://periospot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/giphy-7.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2449\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer -->\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Y es que el sondaje en implantes esta lejos de ser infalible pero, es inocuo, indoloro, no conlleva tiempo ni coste económico y, por tanto, no hay nada que perder y mucho que ganar.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-me-fio-mas-de-lo-que-veo-a-lo-que-me-dice-la-sonda-periodontal\">#3.

Los estudios epidemiológicos muestran que dichos signos aparecen en menos del 50% de los casos con periimplantitis y tan sólo en el 20% de los casos de mucositis (Rodrigo y col 2018). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Lo cuento de otra forma, si basamos nuestro diagnóstico en la inspección visual de los tejidos dejamos de diagnosticar mas del 50% de los casos con periimplantitis y mas del 80% de los casos de mucositis.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-la-radiografia-es-el-metodo-unico-e-infalible-para-el-diagnostico-de-la-periimplantitis\">#4.

Esta cuestión merece una reflexión mas profunda, aunque trataré de ser breve.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">1)Con una radiografía no diagnosticas mucositis. Parece interesante, sino crucial e imperativo, poder diagnosticar el tejido blando con patología antes de que progrese hacia el tejido duro y comience la lesión de periiimplantitis. Esto es de perogrullo, pero como casi todo en el tema que discutimos, por eso insisto.                                                   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">2)  Las panorámicas no son la herramienta ideal para detectar pequeños cambios radiográficos (Tyndall y Brooks 2000; Benic y col. 2013; Schliephake et al. 2003). Sólo las radiografía peripapicales estandarizas con paralizador son útiles.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">3) Por desgracia, incluso la periapicales estandarizadas sólo detectan pérdidas de hueso en mesial y distal,&nbsp; no en palatino ni en vestibular.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">4) Lamentablemente, además, las radiografías sobreestiman el nivel de hueso entre 1 y 2mm (García- García y col 2016; Serino y col 2016). Es decir, si hay pérdida de hueso por debajo de ese umbral, por ejemplo en una periimplantitis inicial, una radiografía no suele detectarlo, y cuando se detecta pérdida de hueso, normalmente hay 1-2mm más de pérdida ósea de lo que aparece en la Rx. De hecho, el 25% de los defectos óseos no son detectables con radiografía, aun siendo periapicales (García- García y col 2016). En este sentido, destaco un estudio reciente sobre la sensibilidad y especificidad de las periapicales estandarizadas que demuestra que están lejos de ser la herramienta diagnostica ideal para defectos óseos, imaginaos las panorámicas!!!. El estudio en cuestión muestra una sensibilidad y valor predictivo negativo de 72 y 50% respectivamente, fuertemente influenciada x la experiencia del examinador que la interpreta, e incapaz de diagnosticar defectos tipo dehiscencias en el 90% de los casos (Pelekos y col 2019) Las radiografías sirven pues para detectar pérdida de hueso sólo en mesial y distal en casos avanzados y/o asentados, no lesiones iniciales. No hay más, no insistáis…..</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer -->\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":2451,\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://periospot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-02-07.36.07.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2451\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer -->\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">En consecuencia, ni el sondaje, ni el sangrado, ni la radiografía muestran ningún atisbo de infalibilidad. Son variables que se complementan en el diagnóstico de salud y enfermedad de los tejidos periimplantarios. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Desgraciadamente, en el lado oscuro, el de los negacionistas, se desprecia la información del sondaje rutinario como complemento a la información de la radiografía y se quedan irremediablemente cortos en el diagnóstico. Si no sondas no puedes diagnosticar mucostis y detectar alteraciones inflamatorias en los tejidos blandos antes de que estas progresen hasta el hueso. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Asimismo, es preferible hacer un diagnóstico de presunción inicial con sondaje, aunque luego quede o no confirmado desmontando y/o con radiografía, que errar al identificar una lesión inicial con radiografía (una vez conocidas sus limitaciones). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Quiero destacar en este sentido el estudio de de Waal (Waal y col 2015). En este trabajo, los <strong><span style=\"color:#0693e3\" class=\"color\">defectos periimplantarios de entre 1-3mm, esos que no siempre se detectan con radiografía</span></strong>, el porcentaje de resolución positiva de la periimplantitis era aproximadamente el doble que para defectos de 5mm o más. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Dicho de otra forma, yo tengo más probabilidad de diagnosticar patología en etapas iniciales y tratarlos de forma mas predecible que alguien que no sonda. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Por cierto, ¿cómo saben los negacionistas de la sonda, después de tratar una periimplantitis, si el tratamiento ha dado resultado satisfactorio?, apretando con el dedo a ver si sale “la pus”?, ¿quedaría englobado dentro del diagnóstico “digital”?. O cómo decía un buen amigo de la profesión…. “si quieres momentos felices, no analices…”, Allá cada cual…</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer -->\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":2450,\"width\":\"455px\",\"height\":\"auto\",\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https://periospot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/PPD-01-1021x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2450\" style=\"width:455px;height:auto\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">El sondaje en implantología es el Gato de Schrödinger de la implantología contemporánea.</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer -->\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-conclusion\">Conclusión</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Los negacionistas tendrán que elegir entre una corriente de pensamiento basada en apenas una decena de estudios y el “a mi me va bien” o el consenso científico a la hora de mantener sus rehabilitaciones implantosoportadas. La inspección visual, la presión digital, y la fe, no parecen herramientas diagnósticas óptimas en este asunto y la radiografía tiene limitaciones objetivas. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Si no diagnosticas no puedes enfocar el plan de tratamiento. Y si no diagnosticas de forma precoz tu tratamiento será menos predecible. No es cuestión baladí este asunto y por tanto quiero decirlo con toda la crudeza que merece, quien no sonda está poniendo en riesgo la salud periimplantaria de sus pacientes y dificultando su tratamiento por detectar patología con lesiones mas avanzadas. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">No sé si Einstein tenía razón o no, pero si tengo la certeza que los perjudicados, en este asunto, son los pacientes de los que no asumen una realidad incontestable.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator {\"opacity\":\"css\"} -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\",\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"font-size:22px\"><strong>Libro recomendado por el autor sobre el tema:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":2469,\"linkDestination\":\"custom\",\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://geni.us/lindheespanol\"><img src=\"https://periospot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/51JTpXxdIL.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2469\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><br></figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:button {\"backgroundColor\":\"vivid-cyan-blue\",\"className\":\"aligncenter\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-button aligncenter\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-background wp-element-button\" href=\"https://geni.us/lindheespanol\">Comprar en Amazon</a></div>\n<!-- /wp:button -->",

Yet, it seems like crestal bone loss was with us forever, and that really for the majority of clinicians became a norm. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Maybe that’s because we all have been taught by Albrektsson and co-authors study published in 1986, that 1.5 mm of bone loss within the first year of loading can be considered as a success if a later bone loss does not exceed 0.2 mm annually. There are so many possible reasons for bone loss, that dentists think that it is not possible to control all of them, and tend to give up the idea of crestal bone stability. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">However, I consider this kind of approach outdated and I refuse to accept the idea that bone loss is unavoidable.

At least 3 major problems can occur in the long term.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-accepting-initial-bone-loss-after-1-year\">Why accepting initial bone loss after 1 year?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">First, clinicians tend to accept initial bone loss after 1 year, as usually bone loss does not progress, however, even if cone levels remain status quo, still there is a substantial threat, that it might lead to significant peri-implantitis, once re-infected. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">We must be aware, that predictable peri-implantitis treatment is still to be developed, thus the best treatment would be prevention, in my opinion. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">On the other hand, let’s admit, that all of us would choose Fig 1 A implant, without bone loss, and not Fig 1B implant, although the difference is very small. Sometimes clinicians tend to downplay this bone loss because simply they do not understand, why the bone is disappearing, and are not eager to learn.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer {\"height\":\"41px\"} -->\n<div style=\"height:41px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":2814,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://periospot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-17-at-07.44.07.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2814\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Fig. 1 (A and B)</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer {\"height\":\"42px\"} -->\n<div style=\"height:42px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-bone-loss-and-short-implants-a-dramatic-relationship\">Bone loss and short implants. A dramatic relationship</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Secondly, crestal bone stability is especially important for short implants, which usage is becoming common practice. Today, an 8 mm long implant is not considered as short anymore, and we have sufficient data to say, that 6 mm long implants work as good as longer ones in posterior areas of both jaws. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">However, imagine, what will happen, if a 6 mm implant is placed in the mandibular posterior jaw region, where thin vertical soft tissues are frequently present? We would have approximately 2 mm of bone resorption, due to biological width formation. It leaves only 2/3 of implant surface osseointegrated. Now, that is a real threat for the implant to fail, having in mind prosthetic suprastructure and implant/crown ratio. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Some implant manufacturers have launched 4 mm length implants, therefore soft tissue thickness is even more important for the users of these products.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer {\"height\":\"39px\"} -->\n<div style=\"height:39px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":2815,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://periospot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-17-at-07.46.55.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2815\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer {\"height\":\"39px\"} -->\n<div style=\"height:39px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-height-of-the-underlining-bone\">Height of the underlining bone</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Finally, it is important that the stability of peri-implant mucosa level around the implant is largely dependent on the height of the underlying bone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">The consequence of marginal peri-implant mucosa migration, as a result of early marginal bone loss, has a major implication in the aesthetics of the restoration, particularly in the anterior area.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer {\"height\":\"40px\"} -->\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":2816,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://periospot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image6-2-1024x683.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2816\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">&nbsp;Crestal bone loss may lead to esthetic meltdown of buccal contour&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer {\"height\":\"35px\"} -->\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">So which factors are important to keep bone stable, and prevent mentioned complications?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Almost for one-decade <a href=\"https://periospot.com/platform-switching-biological-concept/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"platform switching was considered to be the most effective way to achieve this task (opens in a new tab)\"><span style=\"color:#0693e3\" class=\"color\">platform switching was considered to be the most effective way to achieve this task</span></a>.

The saddle connective tissue graft </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">The saddle connective tissue graft associates closure of the extraction site with an increased volume of soft tissues in the buccal part (Chen and Dahlin, 1996). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">The graft is positioned in the vestibular and palatal which involves the realization of a buccal supra-periosteal envelope (about 5mm) and a palatal detachment (about 3mm) to introduce the connective graft while preserving the papilla (Fig.5).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">The increase in the thickness of the buccal gingiva makes it possible to compensate for the irreversible loss of bone volume despite the filling, and thus to obtain the best horizontal and vertical preservation of the soft tissues (Vanhoutte et al., 2014).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">This approach, which is more complex, increases the quantity of soft tissues, particularly in the case of a fine periodontal phenotype, and thus reduces the need for a connective graft during implant placement.

:</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">When implemented, filling techniques significantly reduce the need for complementary surgical techniques (Mardas et al., 2015).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">The healing time required for bone filling before implant placement is variable depending on the study and ranges from 4 to 9 months. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">This time must depend in particular on the importance of the bone filling done and the cofactors that can influence the healing (tobacco, diabetes ...). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">In the majority of the studies, a healing time of 4 months is respected before the installation of the implant: the filling causes a delay of healing in the first phases of the post-extraction bone regeneration. Even if the regeneration is not complete, the placement of the implant will not interrupt it. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">The respect of the time of osseointegration makes it possible to obtain a final healing time of 7 to 8 months before the realization of the prosthetic phase.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">The essentials of pre-implant alveolar filling :</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">- Put an osteoconductive bone material with a low degree of resorption.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">- Isolate the biomaterial of the conjunctival epithelial cells to avoid encapsulation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">- Close the extraction socket and stabilized the clot.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":22}}} -->\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">- Disrupt as little as possible the vascular supply by an atraumatic intervention.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer {\"height\":\"42px\"} -->\n<div style=\"height:42px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"textAlign\":\"center\"} -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-recommended-book\"><span style=\"color:#0693e3\" class=\"color\">Recommended Book</span></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"textAlign\":\"center\"} -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-plastic-esthetic-and-implant-surgery\"><a href=\"https://geni.us/Ucp7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Plastic-Esthetic and Implant  Surgery (opens in a new tab)\"><span style=\"color:#0693e3\" class=\"color\">Plastic-Esthetic and Implant  Surgery</span></a></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":2898,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://geni.us/Ucp7\"><img src=\"https://periospot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/41pDXklviL._SX384_BO1204203200_.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2898\"/></a></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:buttons {\"layout\":{\"type\":\"flex\",\"justifyContent\":\"center\"}} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons\"><!-- wp:button {\"backgroundColor\":\"content_primary\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-content-primary-background-color has-background wp-element-button\" href=\"https://geni.us/Ucp7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Buy Online</a></div>\n<!-- /wp:button --></div>\n<!-- /wp:buttons -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

In ancient Babylonia</a>&nbsp;people chewed on the ends of sticks to create a frayed end for tooth scrubbing.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mouth-health-how-long-hav_b_683535\">Over time and across cultures</a>, people have constructed toothbrushes out of sticks, bones, and animal hairs, and made toothpaste and tooth powder out of everything from ox-hoof ash to burnt eggshells. In the last 150 years or so, tooth brushing has become a much more common practice with the help of modern brushes and paste. In 1873 Colgate was the first to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.colgate.com/en-us/oral-health/basics/brushing-and-flossing/history-of-toothbrushes-and-toothpastes\">mass produce toothpaste</a>, selling it in jars.

Cultures that eat traditional diets have very low rates of tooth decay. As soon as sugars and processed carbohydrates are introduced, dental cavities increase. Deficiencies in iron, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin C, and other nutrients are also known to cause cavities, gum disease, and other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3272860/\">oral disease</a>s.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Aim for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eatright.org/food/vitamins-and-supplements/nutrient-rich-foods/healthy-nutrition-for-healthy-teeth\">balanced diet</a>&nbsp;of minimally processed whole grains, vegetables, fruit, and protein. Limit eating between meals, and if you do snack, choose raw vegetables, firm fruit, or nuts. It’s okay to enjoy occasional refined carbs or sweet treats, but your teeth are likely better off if you eat them with a meal. One&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3272860/#B10\">study</a>&nbsp;suggests eating sugar with a meal doesn’t increase the risk of tooth decay, but snacking on sugar or refined carbs between meals does.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Not minding your microbiome</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Are you trying to eradicate the germs in your mouth with a heavy-duty antibacterial mouthwash or antimicrobial toothpaste? Hold up! Germs are not the enemy we once thought they were. In fact, most of them are your friends.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You’ve probably heard of the human microbiome, the trillions of bacteria and fungi that live in and on our bodies. Hundreds of species of organisms live in your mouth, and they’re organized in ecosystems that could be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/phenomena/2016/01/25/the-forest-in-your-mouth/\">compared to forest ecosystems</a>. When your oral ecosystems are balanced and healthy, microbes work symbiotically to maintain health throughout your body. For instance, some of your oral microbes help&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3605573/\">reduce blood pressure</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bottom line? You want most of the microbes in your mouth to stay put to keep pathogenic bacteria in check.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.blodgettdentalcare.com/is-mouthwash-bad-for-you/\">Be cautious</a>&nbsp;about disrupting your oral microbiome with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0088645\">antibacterial mouthwash</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://today.oregonstate.edu/archives/2016/may/common-antimicrobial-agent-rapidly-disrupts-gut-bacteria\">antibacterial toothpaste</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5378909/\">antibiotics</a>&nbsp;(unless absolutely necessary).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Doing too much of a good thing</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you squeeze a big dollop of toothpaste on your brush several times a day, scrub your teeth like you’d scour a dirty sink, or clean your teeth the minute you finish a meal, you may harm your tooth enamel. Even brushing with a soft brush and toothpaste has been shown to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4623835/\">cause some enamel erosion</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To keep your enamel strong, avoid acidic beverages such as juice and soda, and wait about an hour after eating to brush. Acidic meals soften your tooth enamel and make it more likely to erode when brushing. Use only a pea-sized amount of a non-abrasive toothpaste, hold your toothbrush with a loose grip, and brush gently.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21701198\">Some studies</a>suggest fluoride may help deter enamel erosion, but&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18154-8#Sec2\">more current research</a>&nbsp;implies it doesn’t make a difference. (However, fluoride is helpful for cavity prevention, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/news/20180815/study-fluoride-crucial-to-prevent-cavities\">studies</a>.)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s often said that the mouth is a mirror of health or disease in the body.

edentulismo es un problema de salud publica el cual se debe considerar con mayor importancia ya que la perdida de dientes implica un impacto negativo en la salud general del paciente, opciones como las prótesis totales mucosoportadas convencionales que se han utilizado durante años para el tratamiento de este problema, no todos los pacientes&nbsp; han reportado grados de satisfacción aceptables (especialmente con la prótesis inferior mandíbular) ya que cada paciente es un mundo y difieren tanto en sus necesidades estéticas/funcionales como estilos de vida. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>En un principio, los implantes dentales se comenzaron a emplear con el fin de resolver las necesidades funcionales de los pacientes edentulos (después de observar tasas de éxito favorables se comenzaron a utilizar en casos parciales edentulos y unitarios) ya que gracias a esa fijación extra que dan los implantes dentales mejoran bastante el comportamiento biomecánico de las prótesis, con esto, mejorando la calidad de vida de los pacientes. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Las opciones removibles han reportado grados de satisfacción altos entre sus usuarios, ademas de ventajas tales como un mantenimiento sencillo (inclusive puede realizarse en la clínica) un grado de manejo y acceso a la higiene por parte del paciente de leve a moderado (esto en especial para los pacientes con dificultades motrices y/o con un soporte labial comprometido).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ademas, gracias a los avances en los tratamientos de superficie, diseños de conexión optimizados y utilización de aleaciones que mejoran las propiedades mecánicas de los implantes, se puede reducir la complejidad de procedimientos tanto quirúrgicos como protésicos, disminuyendo morbilidades y tiempos de tratamiento.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No existe una “receta de cocina” para aplicar en nuestros pacientes en la clínica diaria, y el elegir una opción de tratamiento entre todo el abanico de posibilidades, obedece al diagnóstico preciso de la situación clínica presente, ademas el tomar en cuenta el perfil del paciente, sus requerimientos funcionales, estéticos y sus posibilidades, para así realizar un tratamiento personalizado que resuelva su motivo

Y pasan desapercibidos aunque no lo parezca…&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cuando paseas y llegas a la fuente de La Cibeles (si, del Madrid), y desde ahí giras para acceder a la Calle de Alcalá, lo primero que ves es la majestuosidad de un monumento emblemático: La Puerta de Alcalá… ¡No puede pasar desapercibida una cosa así ¡…&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer -->\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":4246,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://periospot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image1-3.jpeg\" alt=\"pastedGraphic.png\" class=\"wp-image-4246\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer -->\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>¡ Pues resulta que si… Que no nos fijamos en los detalles que conforman nuestra rutina.

Hacía una visión de conjunto (posiblemente rápida y sesgada por la costumbre o por la sensación de que siempre estaría ahí) que en junio de 2020 cambió… Ese día me paré y me fijé que los dos lados de la Puerta son totalmente diferentes…&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>La primera puerta de Alcalá la mandó construir en 1559 el Rey Felipe III (para conmemorar la llegada a Madrid de su esposa Doña Margarita de Austria), pero al Rey Carlos III, en 1759, le pareció demasiado modesta y propuso un cambio… Había que derribarla y construir otra más grande, más rica en ornamentos… Una Puerta más acorde con la grandeza de su reinado…&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>En esos años, el “influencer” de la época era un tal Francisco Sabatini. Gran arquitecto al que el Rey encargó el diseño y que presentó dos proyectos: Uno alegórico (columnas, niños o ángeles que representan las virtudes cardinales…) y otro más poderoso (con columnas, trofeos militares, leones y figuras alusivas al poder y prosperidad del momento…). Ambos eran representativos de la figura real, pero había que elegir… El monarca tendría que polarizarse y mostrarse ante el pueblo como un Rey “justo, templado, prudente y fuerte”&nbsp; o como un Rey “poderoso y próspero”…</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Y como era un Rey, eligió los dos: Un diseño por el lado oriental y el otro por el occidental… La puerta se inauguró en 1779, con cinco arcos que le daban suntuosidad y diferenciaban las distintas clases sociales de la época (espero que hoy no se derribe por este motivo), pero que representaban a la vez la doble personalidad de un Rey “total”.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer -->\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[4247,4248]} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://periospot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4247\" data-link=\"https://periospot.com/?attachment_id=4247\" class=\"wp-image-4247\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://periospot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4248\" data-full-url=\"https://periospot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2.jpeg\" data-link=\"https://periospot.com/?attachment_id=4248\" class=\"wp-image-4248\"/></figure></li></ul></figure>\n<!-- /wp:gallery -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer -->\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Desde ese día, La Puerta ha sido testigo de muchos acontecimientos buenos pero también trágicos: el asesinato en 1921 de Eduardo Dato o la Guerra Civil en 1936… Acontecimientos que no han podido con ella como tampoco lo hará el COVID 19.

presente caso clínico se propone la utilización de este abordaje quirúrgico de acceso apical con incisión a fondo de vestíbulo como técnica quirúrgica con una adecuada visibilidad y menores complicaciones postquirúrgicas para la reconstrucción de defectos óseos maxilares. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>La literatura científica ha descrito la utilización de abordajes tunelizados para la reconstrucción de maxilares atróficos tanto en sentido vertical como horizontal a fin de evitar colgajos más amplios, reducir las complicaciones post-operatorias y la morbilidad post-quirúrgica. Varios trabajos recientes proponen abordajes tunelizados para la realización de regeneración ósea vertical con resultados altamente satisfactorios en ganancia ósea y reduciendo la tasa de complicaciones que clásicamente se han asociado a este tipo de procedimientos reconstructivos previos a la colocación de implantes (PA K. 2004, De Stavola 2013).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>El abordaje descrito mediante el caso clínico recién expuesto no ha sido descrito hasta la fecha con fines de regeneración ósea guiada (En realidad Carlo Tinti describió el colgajo en ala de gaviota para usar Goretex) Se debería citar aunque el abordaje es diferente. No obstante, sí que ha sido descrito previamente para cirugía mucogingival (Bethaz N. 2013), regeneración periodontal (Moreno Rodriguez2018, 2019) e incluso reconstrucción de papila (Dino Calzavara 2016). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ofrece una serie de ventajas con respecto a un abordaje crestal tradicional. En primer lugar, alejando la incisión de la zona crítica se consigue reducir el trauma sobre los tejidos blandos que tan importantes serán en la cicatrización de este tipo de procedimientos. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Además, en caso de presencia de complicaciones o dehiscencia de la herida, dicha dehiscencia se ubicará a la distancia suficiente reduciendo los riesgos y presumiblemente la tasa fracaso de procedimientos regenerativos de esta índole descritas en revisiones sistemáticas (Rocchietta 2008, Urban 2019).&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>En relación al origen del injerto óseo las diferentes revisiones sistemáticas respaldan el uso del injerto autólogo como el <em>gold standard</em> (Thoma 2011). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Estudios a largo plazo reportan buenos resultados por tener dos áreas quirúrgicas, incrementar el riesgo de complicaciones en la zona donante y ser una técnica muy sensible pero tienen la desventaja de tener una alta morbilidad por tener dos áreas quirúrgicas y ser una técnica muy sensibles a las manos del operador (Chiapasco 2020). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A fin de reducir la morbilidad post-operatoria, evitar áreas quirúrgicas donantes y reducir el tiempo de intervención se han investigado injertos de diferentes orígenes.

Não podemos utilizar o torque como factor decisivo quanto à sobrevivência dos implantes (Lemos et al. 2020).<br>Duyck et al. (2015) mostrou que implantes colocados com <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">mais torque obtêm mais contacto implante-osso</span> nas primeiras semanas do que os mesmos colocados com menos torque. Contudo, após o período de cicatrização o valor de <em>BIC</em> (<em>bone-to-implant contact</em> - contacto implante osso) é semelhante independentemente do torque de inserção.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"start\":2} -->\n<ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Torque elevado significa estabilidade primária óptima!</strong></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>FALSO!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Quando os micromovimentos excedem 150 µm durante a fase de cicatrização é muito provável que ocorra fibrointegração em vez de osteointegração (Gao 2012).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Então para nos sentirmos confortáveis, principalmente em cargas imediatas, temos a tendência para colocar o implante com torques mais elevados.  No entanto, alguns estudos provam que torque elevado não é sinónimo de inexistência de micromovimentos e não é necessário para carga imediata (Norton 2011).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Neste estudo Norton e a sua equipa provaram que implantes unitários em carga imediata colocados com apenas 25Ncm foi suficiente para atingir taxas de sobrevivências favoráveis e uma manutenção óptima do osso marginal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"start\":3} -->\n<ol start=\"3\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>O torque de inserção do implante influencia o protocolo de carga</strong></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>VERDADE! Mas apenas quando o torque conseguido é reduzido.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Já é do senso comum de um implantologista que se preze o facto de não querer arriscar uma carga imediata sobre um (ou mais) implante(s) colocados com pouco torque.<br>Num estudo sobre restaurações unitárias em carga imediata, Canizzaro et al. (2012) observou uma % de falha de implantes de 14% em implantes com torque reduzido e de 0% em implantes colocados com torques mais elevados. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ainda nas restaurações unitárias, e quando não temos mais com o que decidir, Ottoni et al. (2005) considera que só se deve ponderar carga imediata em implantes colocados com mais que 32Ncm.<br>Joshi et al. (2020) defende que a taxa de sobrevivência de implantes é muito alta desde que se cumpram os torques propostos por Ottoni, independentemente do protocolo de carga.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"start\":4} -->\n<ol start=\"4\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Muito torque é sinónimo de perda óssea marginal</strong></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>FALSO! Nos estudos seleccionados por Lemos et al. (2020) na sua meta-análise, quase todos referem não observar diferenças estatisticamente significativas de perda óssea marginal entre os grupos de torque elevado e baixo/normal. Contudo, é referido o artigo de Marconcini et al. (2018) que verificou mais perda óssea marginal em implantes colocados com torque elevado, relacionando esse facto com uma parede óssea vestibular fina, tal como Barone (2015) observou uma clara perda óssea marginal quando a espessura da parede vestibular é menor que 1mm.<br>Apesar destes dados, a perda óssea marginal é algo influenciado por factores não controláveis tornando difícil relacioná-la apenas com o torque de inserção (Chrcanovic et al. 2014).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Temos que ter em conta também qual a zona anatómica em que vamos colocar o implante, porque a resposta à compressão óssea e a própria densidade do osso difere. Quanto maior a diferença de diâmetro da última broca utilizada e o implante maior o stress a que o osso circundante estará sujeito, Turkyilmaz (2008) defende que a sub-preparação seja apenas feita na região posterior da maxila onde o osso é normalmente menos denso. Se ultrapassarmos o limite fisiológico de osteocompressão em ossos mais densos activaremos a reabsorção óssea (Jimbo et al. 2015).<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":4412,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://periospot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/areas-maxilares-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4412\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"start\":5} -->\n<ol start=\"5\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>A macrogeometria do implante afecta o torque de inserção</strong></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>VERDADE!

Sabatini era um arquitecto proeminente e o Rei encargou-o do desenho e que apresentou dois projectos: um alegórico (colunas, querubins...que representam as virtudes cardinais) e outro mais poderoso (com colunas, troféus militares, leões e figuras alusivas ao poder e prosperidade do momento.

The product arrived in brown, unprinted FSC-certified cardboard packaging, demonstrating a responsible environmental care commitment. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The packaging itself added an eco-friendly touch to the overall experience. This is essential for those more concerned about buying sustainable products from companies that care about the environment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The revolutionary iO technology truly sets this toothbrush apart. Combining Oral-B's unique round brush head with gentle micro-vibrations provided a fresh, clean mouthfeel. I noticed a significant improvement in my gum health within a week compared to using a manual toothbrush.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Welcome to the AI hype- A tooth brush with AI.</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One standout feature is the iO Sense magnetic charging station, which offers personalized live coaching. This helped me understand where and when to clean, ensuring I didn't miss any areas during my brushing routine. The 3D tooth tracking with artificial intelligence also played a vital role in monitoring my cleaning behavior on the outer, inner, and chewing surfaces, resulting in a more thorough cleaning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The interactive color display allowed me to easily choose between seven cleaning programs catering to my personal preferences and oral health needs. These programs include daily cleaning, sensitivity, gum protection, intensive cleaning, whitening, super sensitive, and tongue cleaning. The display also reminded me when to change the brush head and greeted me with a smile for a good cleaning performance.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Pressure control- An essential feature in any electric toothbrush</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the most impressive aspects of the Oral-B iO series is its intelligent pressure control. It lights up red when too much pressure is applied, white when too little pressure is used, and green when the optimal pressure is achieved. This feature helped me perfect my brushing technique and avoid causing unnecessary harm to my gums and teeth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Extra contents but also important</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The box contents included one handpiece, three brush heads, one travel case, one brush holder, and one charging station case – everything needed for a complete oral care experience.

{\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>The importance of electric toothbrushes in persons who are wearing brackets or have implants placed</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The importance of an electric toothbrush for individuals with braces and dental implants cannot be overstated. Both braces and implants require diligent oral care to ensure their longevity and effectiveness. An electric toothbrush is an excellent tool to help maintain optimal oral hygiene in these situations, as it offers several advantages over a traditional manual toothbrush.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Enhanced plaque removal: Electric toothbrushes are known for their ability to remove plaque more efficiently than manual toothbrushes. This is particularly important for individuals with braces or implants, as plaque can easily accumulate around brackets, wires, and implant components. Regular use of an electric toothbrush can help prevent the build-up of plaque, reducing the risk of tooth decay and gum disease.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Better cleaning in hard-to-reach areas: Braces and implants create additional nooks and crannies in the mouth where food particles and plaque can become trapped. Electric toothbrushes, with their oscillating, rotating, or sonic cleaning actions, are better equipped to clean these hard-to-reach areas, ensuring a more thorough clean.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Gentler on gums and teeth: Electric toothbrushes often come with built-in pressure sensors that help prevent users from applying excessive force while brushing. This is particularly beneficial for individuals with braces or implants, as excessive pressure can damage the orthodontic or implant components and cause discomfort.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Customizable cleaning modes: Many electric toothbrushes offer various cleaning modes designed to address specific oral care needs. For example, some toothbrushes feature sensitive or gum care modes that can be particularly useful for individuals with braces or implants, as these modes provide gentle yet effective cleaning around delicate orthodontic or implant components.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Improved oral hygiene habits: Electric toothbrushes typically come with built-in timers that ensure users brush for the dentist-recommended two minutes. This feature helps promote better brushing habits, which is essential for maintaining oral health when wearing braces or having dental implants.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>In conclusion</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An electric toothbrush can play a significant role in maintaining optimal oral hygiene for individuals with braces or dental implants. The enhanced plaque removal, better cleaning in hard-to-reach areas, gentler brushing, customizable cleaning modes, and improved oral hygiene habits all contribute to keeping braces and implants clean and healthy, reducing the risk of complications and promoting overall oral health</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"h-wrapping-up-how-to-select-the-ideal-electric-toothbrush-for-your-oral-health\"><strong>Wrapping Up: How to Select the Ideal Electric Toothbrush for Your Oral Health </strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Although it is difficult to choose the best electric toothbrush for 2023, I think that we have <a href=\"https://geni.us/0cenYzz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a winner this year</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After evaluating the top 10 electric toothbrushes of 2023, we can confidently recommend the <a href=\"https://geni.us/0cenYzz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Oral-B iO Series</a> as the best overall option due to its revolutionary magnetic iO technology, comprehensive features, 3D teeth tracking with AI, and a sense smart charger for personalized live coaching.

-->\n<p>Staying focused and productive while working from home can be challenging, especially when dealing with distractions such as household chores, family members, or the temptation to scroll through social media. Implementing effective focusing techniques can help you <a href=\"https://clickup.pxf.io/c/1445481/1416724/16855\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">maintain productivity</a> and make the most of your workday. Here are some strategies to improve your focus while working from home:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Pomodoro Technique:</strong>&nbsp;Break your workday into 25-minute intervals (called Pomodoros) followed by a 5-minute break. After completing four Pomodoros, take a more extended break of 15-30 minutes. This method encourages intense focus during work sessions and allows for regular mental recovery breaks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Time Blocking:</strong>&nbsp;Schedule specific tasks or activities for designated time slots throughout the day. This can help you stay focused on one task at a time and prevent multitasking or task-switching, which can reduce productivity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Eliminate Distractions:</strong>&nbsp;Identify and minimize sources of distraction in your workspace, such as turning off notifications on your phone or using noise-canceling headphones to block out background noise.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Set Daily Goals:</strong>&nbsp;Begin each day by setting clear, achievable goals for what you want to accomplish. This can help you stay focused and motivated as you work towards completing each task.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Practice Mindfulness:</strong>&nbsp;Incorporate mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or short meditation sessions, into your daily routine to improve focus, reduce stress, and enhance overall well-being.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To help illustrate how these focusing techniques can be applied, here's an example of a daily home office agenda:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>8:00 am - 8:30 am:</strong>&nbsp;Review daily goals and priorities, and set a clear intention for the day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>8:30 am - 9:25 am:</strong>&nbsp;First Pomodoro - work on a high-priority task with complete focus.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>9:25 am - 9:30 am</strong>: 5-minute break - stretch, grab a drink or do a quick mindfulness exercise.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>9:30 am - 10:25 am:</strong>&nbsp;Second Pomodoro - continue working on the high-priority task.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>10:25 am - 10:30 am:</strong>&nbsp;5-minute break.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>10:30 am - 11:25 am:</strong>&nbsp;Third Pomodoro - work on another important task.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>11:25 am - 11:30 am:</strong>&nbsp;5-minute break.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>11:30 am - 12:25 pm:</strong>&nbsp;Fourth Pomodoro - complete a smaller task or respond to emails.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>12:25 pm - 1:00 pm:</strong>&nbsp;35-minute lunch break - eat a healthy meal, take a walk, or chat with a friend or family member.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1:00 pm - 2:25 pm:</strong>&nbsp;Time block for a scheduled virtual meeting or collaboration session.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2:25 pm - 2:30 pm:</strong>&nbsp;5-minute break.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2:30 pm - 3:25 pm:</strong>&nbsp;Fifth Pomodoro - work on any remaining tasks or projects.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3:25 pm - 3:30 pm</strong>: 5-minute break.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3:30 pm - 4:25 pm:</strong>&nbsp;Sixth Pomodoro - wrap up loose ends and update progress on daily goals.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>4:25 pm - 4:30 pm:</strong>&nbsp;5-minute break.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>4:30 pm - 5:00 pm:</strong>&nbsp;Time block for administrative tasks, such as updating project status, organizing files, or planning for the next day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>5:00 pm - 5:30 pm:</strong>&nbsp;Wind-down routine - review your accomplishments for the day, reflect on any challenges or lessons learned, and mentally prepare to transition from work to personal time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another powerful focusing technique that can be highly effective for remote work is the concept of \"<a href=\"https://geni.us/deepwork2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">deep work,\" introduced by Cal Newport</a>&nbsp;in his book of the same name. Deep work is the ability to engage in cognitively demanding tasks without distraction, allowing you to produce high-quality results in less time.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>According to Newport, deep work is essential for achieving peak productivity and mastering complex skills in today's knowledge-based economy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://geni.us/deepwork2\">his book, Newpor</a>t outlines several rules and strategies to help cultivate a deep work mindset and maximize productivity while working from home:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Work deeply</strong>: Schedule blocks of time for deep work, where you can focus on challenging tasks without interruptions. Set clear boundaries around this time, and inform family members or housemates when you're engaging in deep work to minimize distractions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Embrace boredom:</strong>&nbsp;Train yourself to resist the temptation of checking your phone or browsing social media during moments of boredom. Instead, use these moments to reflect, recharge, or engage in deliberate practice.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Quit social media:&nbsp;</strong>While this may seem drastic, reducing or eliminating your use of social media can help minimize distractions and free up more time for deep work. If quitting entirely isn't feasible, consider limiting your daily social media usage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Drain the shallows:</strong>&nbsp;Identify and reduce shallow tasks, such as answering non-urgent emails or attending low-value meetings, which can consume valuable time and prevent you from engaging in deep work. Delegate, automate or batch these tasks to maximize the time available for focused, high-priority work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By implementing these deep work principles, you can create an environment that fosters focused productivity and enhances your ability to tackle complex tasks while working from home. Embracing deep work can help you unlock your full potential, sharpen your skills, and achieve greater accomplishment and satisfaction in your work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, incorporating these focus techniques and establishing a structured daily agenda can enhance productivity and maintain a healthy work-life balance. Remember that it's essential to prioritize your well-being while working from home, so be sure to include regular breaks, physical activity, and social interaction (even if it's virtual) to avoid burnout and maintain overall mental health.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"h-final-thoughts\"><br>Final thoughts&nbsp;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Designing a modern, functional, and comfortable home office is essential for those working from home, whether it's a temporary arrangement or a long-term shift. A well-designed home office can significantly enhance productivity, work-life balance, and well-being. However, working from a contemporary home office also presents challenges that should be addressed to maintain a healthy lifestyle and prevent feelings of isolation or burnout.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The benefits of using modern home offices and working from home include increased flexibility, reduced commuting time, and the ability to customize your workspace to suit your needs and preferences. By following the tips and strategies provided in this article, you can create a stylish, ergonomic, and efficient home office that supports your unique work style and promotes success.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the other hand, working from home may lead to a sedentary lifestyle, feelings of isolation, and difficulty separating work and personal life. To combat these challenges, it's essential to prioritize wellness, movement, and social interaction. Here are some recommendations to stay healthy, both physically and mentally, while working from home:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Exercise regularly:</strong> Schedule time for daily physical activity, whether it's a home workout, a walk around the neighborhood, or a yoga session. Exercise can help reduce stress, improve mood, and maintain physical health.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Break up your workday:</strong> Take regular breaks throughout the day to stretch, move, or engage in a brief non-work-related activity. This can help prevent burnout and improve focus.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Stay connected:</strong> Schedule virtual coffee meetings, video calls, or group chats to stay in touch with colleagues, friends, and family. Maintaining social connections can help alleviate feelings of isolation and loneliness.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Practice self-care:</strong> Allocate time for relaxation, hobbies, and personal interests outside work hours. Reading, meditating, or engaging in creative pursuits can help balance work and personal life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Set boundaries:</strong> Establish clear boundaries between work and personal spaces in your home. Create a designated workspace and avoid working in areas for relaxation, such as the bedroom, dining room, or living room.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In conclusion, working from home presents both opportunities and challenges. By designing a comfortable, functional, and personalized home office space and incorporating healthy habits into your daily routine, you can maximize the work-from-home experience and maintain a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",
